# Chucky SDK

Chucky provides **Claude as a Service** - a fully managed infrastructure for deploying AI agents powered by Claude. Build conversational AI applications without managing servers, handling authentication complexity, or worrying about scaling.

## The Problem

Building AI features into your product sounds simple: call the API, get a response, show it to users. But once you ship, reality hits:

| Challenge | What You Need to Build | Time |
|-----------|------------------------|------|
| **Billing** | Usage tracking, budget limits, Stripe metering, usage-based billing | 2-4 weeks |
| **Execution** | Sandboxed environments, file system isolation, process management | 4-8 weeks |
| **Tools** | Tool execution routing, browser-to-server communication, error handling | 2-4 weeks |
| **Sessions** | Persistence, context management, message history, resume logic | 1-2 weeks |

That's **9-18 weeks** of infrastructure work before you can ship your AI feature.

## The Chucky Solution

Chucky handles all of this with one SDK:

```typescript
// Billing, execution, tools, sessions - all handled.
const client = new ChuckyClient({ token });
const result = await client.prompt('Deploy my code to production');
```

**Built-in per-user billing:** JWT tokens carry budgets. Enforcement happens at the edge.

```typescript
const token = await createToken({
  userId: 'user-123',
  budget: createBudget({
    aiDollars: 5.00,    // User can spend up to $5
    computeHours: 1,    // And 1 hour of compute
    window: 'day',      // Resets daily
  }),
});
```

When the budget runs out, requests stop. No surprise bills.

## Comparison

| Capability | Direct API | Chucky |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| Per-user billing | Build it yourself | Built-in |
| Budget enforcement | Build it yourself | Automatic |
| Code execution | Build it yourself | Managed sandbox |
| File operations | Not available | Full access |
| Shell commands | Not available | Full access |
| Browser tools | Build it yourself | Native support |
| Local execution | Build it yourself | Possession Mode |
| Session persistence | Build it yourself | Automatic |
| Multi-turn context | Build it yourself | Automatic |
| Git integration | Build it yourself | Built-in bundles |

## Who Uses Chucky

**Agencies Billing Clients:** Deploy once, bill each client automatically. JWT tokens carry per-client budgets. No custom metering code per project.

**SaaS Teams Adding AI:** Add AI features without building infrastructure. Set budgets per subscription tier. Ship in days, not months.

**Indie Developers:** One SDK, one deployment. Focus on your product, not on building AI infrastructure.

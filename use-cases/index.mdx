These guides walk through real-world applications of Chucky, from AI-powered CLI tools to browser extensions and white-label platforms.

## Featured Use Cases

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="AI CLI Tools" icon="terminal" href="/use-cases/cli-tools">
    Build command-line tools with Possession Mode - Claude reasons in the cloud while tools execute on the user's machine.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Browser Extensions" icon="chrome" href="/use-cases/browser-extensions">
    Create Chrome/Firefox extensions where Claude reads pages, extracts data, and manipulates the DOM.
  </Card>
  <Card title="White-Label Platform" icon="building" href="/use-cases/white-label">
    Deploy once, bill each client automatically with per-user budgets and usage tracking.
  </Card>
  <Card title="CI/CD Integration" icon="git-branch" href="/use-cases/cicd">
    Add AI to your pipeline for PR reviews, changelog generation, and automated refactoring.

## Quick Examples

### AI Dev Automation

```bash
# Fix TypeScript errors with local execution
chucky prompt "Fix all TypeScript errors" --allow-possession

# Review and refactor
chucky prompt "Review this file for security issues" --apply
```

### Browser Control

```typescript
// Tools that manipulate the page
const extractTool = {
  name: 'extract_data',
  handler: async ({ selector }) => {
    const data = document.querySelector(selector)?.textContent;
    return textResult(data || 'Not found');
  }
};
```

### Per-User Billing

```typescript
// Token with embedded budget
const token = await createToken({
  userId: user.id,
  budget: createBudget({ aiDollars: 5, computeHours: 1, window: 'day' }),
});
```

### Scheduled Tasks

```json
// .chucky.json
{
  "crons": [{
    "cron": "0 9 * * 1-5",
    "message": "Review open PRs and suggest improvements"
  }]
}
```

## What Makes These Different

These aren't just AI features - they're applications that require Chucky's unique architecture:

| Capability | Why Chucky |
|------------|-----------|
| **Local execution** | Possession Mode lets Claude reason in the cloud but execute on user's machine |
| **Browser tools** | Same SDK runs in browser with DOM access |
| **Auto billing** | JWT tokens carry budgets, enforced at edge |
| **Scheduled AI** | Managed cron infrastructure with full sandbox |
| **CI/CD AI** | Background jobs with webhook callbacks |

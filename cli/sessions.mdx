# Sessions

Sessions represent individual interactions with Claude in the Chucky cloud. Every `chucky prompt` command and every job creates a session. Use the sessions command to view history, track usage, and access changes made during sessions.

## List Sessions

```bash
chucky sessions [options]
```

### Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `-l, --limit <number>` | Number of sessions to show | `20` |
| `--with-bundle` | Only show sessions with git bundles | `false` |
| `--json` | Output raw JSON response | `false` |

### Examples

**List recent sessions:**

```bash
chucky sessions
```

**Show only sessions with changes:**

```bash
chucky sessions --with-bundle
```

**JSON output for scripting:**

```bash
chucky sessions --json --limit 50
```

## Output

The sessions list shows:

```
abc12345 completed   3.2s   $0.0123 cli-user        [bundle]
def67890 completed   1.5s   $0.0045 cli-user
ghi11223 failed      0.8s   $0.0012 api-user
jkl44556 running     -      -       webhook-user    job:run_xyz789
```

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ID | First 8 characters of session ID |
| Status | `completed`, `failed`, or `running` |
| Duration | Time taken to complete |
| Cost | Total API cost in USD |
| User ID | User identifier from JWT token |
| `[bundle]` | Indicates session has file changes |
| `job:...` | Associated job ID (for background jobs) |

## Session Status

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `running` | Session is currently active |
| `completed` | Session finished successfully |
| `failed` | Session encountered an error |

## Accessing Session Changes

When a session modifies files (indicated by `[bundle]`), you can fetch and apply those changes:

```bash
# Use the session ID (partial IDs work)
chucky fetch abc12345

# View what changed
chucky diff abc12345

# Apply changes
chucky apply abc12345

# Or do fetch + apply in one step
chucky pull abc12345
```

See [Git Bundles](/cli/bundles) for detailed documentation.

## Filtering by Project

When run from a directory with a `.chucky.json` file, sessions are automatically filtered to that project. To see all sessions across projects, run the command from outside any Chucky project directory.
